# Repository Guidelines

With UDD, the Kepware prodcut teams at PTC wanted to provide a easy and modern way to share example profiles that customers can use and extend for connectivity needs. This repository is intended to provide end users access to example profiles, collaborate and share profiles, and share feedback on issues they may have. The repository is owned and maintained by the Kepware Solutions Consulting team at PTC.

Because the profiles are provided "as-is" per the [licensing terms](../license.md) there is no guarenteed response whenever an Issue is reported or question posted. In some cases, the owners may reach out to you directly in response to an issue/question and coordinate other means to share data as needed.

## Versions of UDD Profiles

Profiles have versions, which follow the pattern: \<major>.\<minor>.\<update>, where a minor versions of a major version are backwards compatible with each other. The \<update> designation is for updates to a profile for issue resolution.

## Pull Requests

Pull Requests can be created by any user wanting to contribute to the repo. The owners of the repo will approve pull requests as changes are reviewed and will determine if changes meet the intent of the repository.

## Issues

The issues feature of GitHub will be used as the primary means of communication.  An issue may be a bug report, a feature request, a question about how to use of a profile, etc.  When creating or working issues, contributors are encouraged to use permalinks to link to other files in a repo.  Crosslinking of issues, when they are related, is also encouraged. When creating pull requests that resolve issues, include the Issue as a cross link in the PR.
