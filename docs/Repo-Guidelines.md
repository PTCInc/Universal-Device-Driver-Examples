# Repository Guidelines

With UDD, the Kepware prodcut teams at PTC wanted to provide a easy and modern way to share example profiles that customers can use and extend for connectivity needs. This repository is intended to provide end users access to example profiles, collaborate and share profiles, and share feedback on issues they may have. The repository is owned and maintained by the Kepware Solutions Consulting team at PTC.

Because the profiles are provided "as-is" per the [licensing terms](../license.md) there is no guarenteed response whenever an Issue is reported or question posted. In some cases, the owners may reach out to you directly in response to an issue/question and coordinate other means to share data as needed.

## Versions of UDD Profiles

Profiles have versions, which follow the pattern: \<major>.\<minor>.\<update>, where a minor versions of a major version are backwards compatible with each other. The \<update> designation is for updates to a profile for issue resolution.

If a profile is versioned as a beta version (\<major>.\<minor>.\<update>beta), this is an indication that it was initially developed using the documentation from the vendor and validated against precreated responses and NOT hardware. Once it has been validated against hardware, the beta label will be removed from the profile. If you would like to assist in testing against hardware, please reach out to us in the Discussions area of the repository to coordinate with the team.

Device profiles may have legacy versions stored in folders labeled "archive". These are stored for reference as needed and not updated.

## Pull Requests

Pull Requests can be created by any user wanting to contribute to the repo. The owners of the repo will approve pull requests as changes are reviewed and will determine if changes meet the intent of the repository.

## Issues and Discussions in Github

The Issues and Discussions features of GitHub will be used as the primary means of communication.  An issue may be a bug report or identifying an issue found wtih a profile. When creating or working issues, contributors are encouraged to use permalinks to link to other files in a repo.  Crosslinking of issues, when they are related, is also encouraged. When creating pull requests that resolve issues, include the Issue as a cross link in the PR.

If there is a question about how to use of a profile, recommended feature request, or general inquiries should be made in the Discussions section of the repo.
