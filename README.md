## Overview

Kepware's [Universal Device driver (UDD)](https://www.kepware.com/products/kepserverex/drivers/udd/) accelerates creating user-defined custom driver profiles using JavaScript enabling greater visibility to Tier 2 and Tier 3 niche manufacturing devices including barcode readers, weigh scales, various sensors and RTUs. The introduction of a self-describing and generic development framework and scripting engine gives the writer flexible control over managing driver aspects like basic communication types as well as build and parse messaging. Users can create UDD profiles and configure multiple instances of the profile to connect with their devices.

Example profiles for various hardware and protocol use cases can be found in this repository.

## Prerequisites

Profiles in this repository target the UDD v2.0 design included in Thingworx Kepware Server (TKS) and KEPServerEX (KEP) v6.11 or later.

## Issues

As stated in the disclaimer and license of this repository, these profiles are provided "as-is". For any questions or problems that are encountered, please open an Issue within the repository. See [Repository Guidelines](docs\Repo-Guidelines.md) for more information.
